# QPKG Development Guidelines
----------------------------------

# Description

QDK is used to build QPKG files/applications for QNAP Turbo NAS. A QPKG file makes it easy for anyone to install and remove packages. It also gives a package maintainer almost total control on how the package is installed on the NAS.
The major design goal of QDK is to make it easy for the package maintainer to create simple QPKG files and at the same time also support more advanced packages. QDK started out as a simple modification of the first official release of the QPKG SDK, but now supersedes it. It includes many new features like architecture check at installation, support for digital signatures, different compression algorithms, a comprehensive option to check that other required QPKG packages are installed (or that conflicting packages are not installed), and a powerful build script.
#### Form QTS 4.2.0 on, no support Optware.

# License

QDK is distributed under the GPL making it completely open and available for anyone to use.

# Installation

Download and install the QPKG file and it will automatically create the system-wide configuration file, /etc/config/qdk.conf, and when enabled it also creates a symlink for qbuild in /usr/bin. The reference manual is included in a separate zip file. There is also a document (QDK Cookbook) with solutions to different common situations that you could run into when using QDK to build QPKG packages.

# How to add icons in QPKG
Location of directory with icons for the packaged software. Default location is a directory named icons in $QDK_ROOT_DIR. 
The value must be a full path or a path relative to $QDK_ROOT_DIR. The icons shall be named ${QPKG_NAME}.gif, ${QPKG_NAME}_80.gif, and ${QPKG_NAME}_gray.gif.

* ${QPKG_NAME}.gif is the image displayed in the web interface when the QPKG is enabled. It should be a GIF image of 64x64 pixels.

* ${QPKG_NAME}_gray.gif is the image displayed in the web interface when the QPKG is disabled. It should be a GIF image of 64x64 pixels. It is usually a greyscale version of the ${QPKG_NAME}.gif image, but that is not a requirement.

* ${QPKG_NAME}_80.gif is the image displayed in the pop-up dialog (with information about the QPKG and the buttons to enable, disable, and remove). It should be a GIF image of 80x80 pixels. If no icons are included then the QPKG is given default icons at installation.
